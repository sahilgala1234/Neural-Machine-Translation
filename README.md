# Neural-Machine-Translation
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is the task of using articial neural network models for translation from one
language to the other. 
The NMT model generally consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a xed-length vector from which
a decoder generates a translation.
This project can be thought as a prediction problem, where given a sequence of words in source language as input,
task is to predict the output sequence of words in target language.
The dataset comes from http://www.manythings.org/anki/, where you may nd tab delimited bilingual sentence pairs in
different les based on the source and target language of your choice
